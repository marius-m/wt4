# Changelog

Current: 1.9.4


## 1.9.7

-   Still same problem remains for code sign on *MacOS*, so you&rsquo;ll have to run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WT4-basic.app` for the app to launch.

-   **Features**
    -   When importing logs lets you to find ticket code from comment and bind it to the ticket. Very useful when trying to use multiple JIRA&rsquo;s


## 1.9.6

-   Still same problem remains for code sign on *MacOS*, so you&rsquo;ll have to run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WT4-basic.app` for the app to launch.

## 1.9.5

-   Still same problem remains for code sign on *MacOS*, so you&rsquo;ll have to run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/WT4-basic.app` for the app to launch.

-   **Experimental release** with some experimental features

-   **Fixes**
    -   Fixed worklog sync where comments would not provide a value from JIRA (this is controllable variable from JIRA itself)

-   **Features**
    -   Integrate ability to provide help sections to features in screen (aka helpful tips). Now some of more hidden features would be more visible. Still need to add more help sections for this to be more helpful
    -   (Experimental) More info on your current day and its pace (How much time is left to complete the day)

    -   Time would remove when focus is gone from time selection field
    -   Filter tinker that would provide more values

## 1.9.2

-   New OS systems introduced new challenges for the app to work properly, needed to repackage with newest JRE + JFX modules (MacOS had problems, also M1)
    -   New OS also introduced in breaking JFX UI components and misbehaving, had to replace them entirely. So now we have *new time and date selection*

    -   Hopefully this fixes code signing and launch problems as well ðŸ¤ž
-   Logging changed from `Log4j` to `logback`
    -   Changed due to having more experience, more logs are piped therough (now it should even pipe System.out)
    -   Also `Log4j` having infamous bug, however it should not cause too many problems, as it is a local app and does not expose anything outside (unlike web)
